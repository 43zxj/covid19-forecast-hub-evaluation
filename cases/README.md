## Evaluation of Incident Case Forecasts

We present evaluations for weekly incident case forecasts for the US, state-by-state, and county-by-county.

All formats and columns in the [`evaluations`](/cases/evaluations) directory follow the same pattern as the forecast [evaluations for deaths](/evaluations).

The results are summarized in the [`summary`](/cases/summary) directory.
